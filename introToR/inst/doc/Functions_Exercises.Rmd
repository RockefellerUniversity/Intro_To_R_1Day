These exercises cover the vectors sections of [Introduction to R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/introToR_Day1.html). 

-- Create a function which takes one argument and finds the smallest number whose factorial is greater than that argument.(Look at answer from previous exercises)


-- Create a function which takes a vector argument and returns both the number of even perfect squares and a vector of  perfect squares found in the vector argument. 

-- Create a function which takes an argument of the directory containing expression files and the name of the annotation file and writes a the table with all samples' expression results and all annotation to file.  (Look at answer from previous exercises)


-- Adapt the above function to also write a  t-test result table filtered by the p-value cut-off. An additional argument specifying the allocation a samples into groups must be specified.(Look at answer from previous exercises)


To retrieve the indicies of the **first** occurence of every element in one vector in a second vector you can use the **match()** function.

```{r,message=T}
allSamples <- c("sample1.txt","sample2.txt","sample3.txt","sample4.txt","sample5.txt","sample5.txt")
testSamples <- c("sample1.txt","sample5.txt")
match(testSamples,allSamples)
allSamples[match(testSamples,allSamples)]
```

To find **all** occurences of vector in another you can use the **%in%** operator

```{r,message=T}

allSamples <- c("sample1.txt","sample2.txt","sample3.txt","sample4.txt","sample5.txt")
testSamples <- c("sample1.txt","sample5.txt")
allSamples %in% testSamples
allSamples[allSamples %in% testSamples]
```
