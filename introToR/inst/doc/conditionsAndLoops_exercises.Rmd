These exercises cover the vectors sections of [Introduction to R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/introToR_Day1.html). 


-- Calculate the factorial (factorial of 3 = 3 * 2 * 1) of 10 using a loop.

-- Adjusting your answer from before, what is the first number that has a factorial greater than 1000.

-- Using an ifelse() expression, create a factor from a vector of 1 to 40 where all numbers less than 10 are "small",10 to 30 are "mid",31 to 40 are "big"


-- Read in all files from expression directory with .txt extension and create a table of gene expression results.

-- Add annotation from Annotation.txt. How do the pathway information for genes compare between expression table and annotation table.
