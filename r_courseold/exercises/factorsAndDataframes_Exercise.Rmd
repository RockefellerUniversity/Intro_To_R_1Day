These exercises cover the factors and dataframes sections of [Introduction to R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Intro_To_R_1Day/).

**Exercise 1** - **Factors**


- Create a ordinal factor named "Height" containing -- high, low, mid, low, mid, low, mid, high, mid, high.
- Using a logical index, create new factor of only those from "Height"" greater than low.
- Replace the last index in "Height" with veryHigh and create new factor with those greater than mid.

**Exercise 2** - **Data frames**

- Create a data frame called Annotation with a column of gene names ("Gene_1", "Gene_2", "Gene_3","Gene_4","Gene_5"),  ensembl gene names ("Ens001", "Ens003", "Ens006", "Ens007", "Ens010"),  pathway information ("Glycolysis", "TGFb", "Glycolysis", "TGFb", "Glycolysis") and  gene lengths (100, 3000, 200, 1000,1200).

- Create data frame called Sample1 with ensembl gene names ("Ens001", "Ens003", "Ens006", "Ens010") and expression  (1000, 3000, 10000,5000)

- Create data frame called Sample2 with ensembl gene names ("Ens001", "Ens003", "Ens006", "Ens007","Ens010") and expression  (1500, 1500, 17000,500,10000)

- Create a data frame containing only those gene names common to all data frames with all information from Annotation and the expression from Sample 1 and Sample 2.

- Add an extra two columns containing the length normalised expressions for Sample 1 and Sample 2

- Identify the mean length normalised expression across Sample1 and Sample2 for Ens006 genes

- For all genes, identify the log2 fold change in length normalised expression from Sample 1 to Sample 2.

- Identify the total length of genes in Glycolysis pathway.
