These exercises cover the statistics sections of [Introduction to R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Intro_To_R_1Day/). 

**Exercise 1**

- Read in the file categoriesAndExpression.txt.
- How many genes are ofInterest and how many in pathways.
- What are quantiles of expression overall, in Glycolysis genes and in TGFb genes.
- How many genes were selected and in glycolysis pathway.
- Given a normal distibution for the data, what is the probablity of selecting a gene with at least the expression level of "Gene18"
- Perform a t-test to evaluate the difference between Selected and NotSelected genes and Glycolysis and TGFb pathway.

**Exercise 2**

- Read in the file lmExercise.txt.
- What is the formula for the best fit lines for X vs Y and X vs Z
- What are the Rsquared for X vs Y and X vs Z.
- Predict values for X when Y is 100 and Z is 100.
